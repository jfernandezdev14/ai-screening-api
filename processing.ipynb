      "_x000b_Hello my name is Lucia, I currently live in Argentina, i moved here about 12 years ago, before that I used to live in the US. I've mostly worked on sales, I used to sell financial plans for new cars. Sales is something I really enjoy, because you always have the possibility to challenge yourself to be better and achive success. being a salesperson has helped me become a more outspoken person. I was able to use my empathy and understanding to my advantage to help the clients choose the right financial plan for them. I believe that organization is the key to success. I'm a fast learner and a hard worker, striving to reach my goals and help others reach theirs. I'm a passionate learner and a problem solver, always looking for new opportunities to broaden my knowledge. Ready to take on any challenge that comes my way                       1\n",
